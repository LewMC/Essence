# Welcome to the Essence Contributor Guide!
Thanks for contributing to Essence! We really appreciate you helping us out.

# What can I do?
We usually have a full list of tasks scheduled for the next update in our [milestones page](https://github.com/LewMC/Essence/milestones).
If this is empty, you can also take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/LewMC/Essence/issues), or add anything else you think would be a good fit!

## Testing
Please ensure you test all your additions in as many ways as you can.
All of our automated tests must pass, and we ask that you go in-game to check they work too.
The way we do it is we try to break it.
Try to make it do things it shouldn't.
That's usually a good indicator to if it works, but every feature is different and you should test it how you see fit.

# Where to Merge
Please merge any changes into the `next-update` branch, not the `main` branch.
This helps us to ensure that our snapshot builds are labelled as snapshot so that it is clear to users download them that they are still in development, and that any changes being made will work with future versions of Essence.
